### imp tasks:

6. Handle multiple promises
mandatory

Import `signUpUser` from `4-user-promise.js` and `uploadPhoto` from `5-photo-reject.js`.

Write and export a function named ``handleProfileSignup``. It should accept three arguments `firstName` (string), `lastName` (string), and `fileName` (string). The function should call the two other functions. When the promises are all settled it should return an array with the following structure:
```js
[
    {
      status: status_of_the_promise,
      value: value or error returned by the Promise
    },
    ...
  ]
```
